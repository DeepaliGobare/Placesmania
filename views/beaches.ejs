        Away from the polluted city life and untouched by the industrial
        pollution, Marve beach is in Malad. The beach is comparatively small and
        narrow due to the fast sinking mud and swift currents, which also makes
        it dangerous to swim. The place though is a quiet affair and is an ideal
        place if you want to spend some moments either alone or with the loved
        one. The beach is lined up with amazing villa properties generally
        belonging to the elite class of Mumbai, one of the reasons why the beach
        has a high cleanliness quotient.
