        This iconic avenue, which runs alongside the Arabian Sea, is a popular
        site for watching sunsets and is particularly beautiful when lit up at
        night. Marine Drive is a three-kilometer-long promenade in Mumbai that
        runs parallel to the NSB road. After dusk, you can go to either end of
        Marine Drive and see the lights shining in a beautiful arc all along the
        coast, which is hidden by palm trees. People come here to walk in the
        evenings to see the spectacular sunset. It's also one of the spots where
        people go late at night, with vendors selling chai and cigarettes at all
        hours of the day and night. A picture of the Mumbai skyline, the sound

        The Gateway of India, located near Apollo Bunder in South Mumbai, on the
        Arabian Sea's beach, is India's most unique monument. The structural
        construction of the Gateway of India is built on a gigantic arch. The
        monument is composed of yellow basalt and indissoluble concrete. The
        structural plan of the Gateway of India is designed in the
        Indo-Saracenic style. There are also remains of Muslim architectural
        styles in the massive monument's structure. The four turrets are the
        most prominent features of the Gateway of India's overall design. Behind
        the Gateway's arch, which leads to the Arabian Sea, there are steps
        built. The monument is constructed so that visitors may instantly
        observe the vast length of the 'blue blanket,' which is both welcome and
        comforting.
